# Gizem Tuğuz — Portfolio

Modern single-page portfolio built with React and Vite to showcase Gizem Tuğuz’s work across front-end development, UI/UX, AI-powered products, and community leadership.

## Overview
- Hero, About, Skills, Projects, GitHub, and Contact sections with smooth in-page navigation.
- Light/dark theme toggle persisted via `localStorage` and system-like styling.
- Interactive GitHub contribution calendar with multiple fallback data sources.
- Contact form wired to FormSubmit for hassle-free email delivery and inline validation.
- Case-study driven project cards that highlight tools, tech stack, and downloadable PDFs.

## Tech Stack
- React 19 with functional components and hooks
- Vite 7 build tooling with hot module replacement
- Modern CSS (custom properties, responsive layout, accessibility-first semantics)

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app becomes available at the address printed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Preview the production build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Project Structure
- `src/App.jsx` – top-level composition for navigation, sections, and theme logic.
- `src/data.js` – central place for profile metadata, skills, project entries, and GitHub links.
- `src/componenets/GithubContributionCalendar.tsx` – contribution heatmap with resilient API fallbacks (Jogruber ➜ Vercel ➜ GitHub HTML scrape).
- `src/projects/` – case studies (PDF) and project imagery referenced from `data.js`.
- `src/styles.css` and `src/App.css` – global design tokens, layout primitives, and section styling.

## Customisation Tips
- Update personal details, skills, or projects by editing `src/data.js`; the UI reflects changes instantly.
- Replace the hero image in `src/assets/avatar.JPG` to use a different portrait.
- Add or remove projects by updating the `PROJECTS` array—stack labels, links, and case-study assets are all configurable.
- The GitHub section pulls live data for `gizemtuguz`; supply a different username through the `GithubContributionCalendar` prop if you fork the project.

## Integrations & Notes
- **GitHub Calendar**: Tries Jogruber’s API, then a Vercel edge endpoint, and finally a proxied GitHub HTML scrape to render contribution cells. Console warnings indicate which source failed, falling back automatically.
- **FormSubmit Contact Form**: Submits to `https://formsubmit.co/ajax/gizemtuguz@gmail.com` with spam protection disabled (`_captcha=false`). Update the email address if you clone this repo, and consider re-enabling CAPTCHA in production.
- **Accessibility**: Includes skip links, labeled controls, keyboard-visible focus states, and ARIA labels for interactive media.

## Linting
Run ESLint to keep the project tidy:
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Deployment
Any static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.) can serve the `dist/` output generated by `npm run build`. Remember to configure caching headers for assets and update environment-specific links if needed.
